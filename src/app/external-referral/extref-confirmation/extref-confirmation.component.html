		 We will also send someone out to see you. They will gather facts to make sure you have an intellectual or developmental disability. If you do, but we can’t enroll you in the program now, we’ll put you on the referral list. We’ll also put you on the list if you have an intellectual or developmental disability but don’t want services until later.

    </div>

    <div>
        If you’re on the referral list, we’ll contact you at least once a year to see if anything has changed or if we can help you find other services.
